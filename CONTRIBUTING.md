# Contributing

Contributions to **IT Documentation Templates** are appreciated. These templates are meant to be generic, and improvements or new templates can benefit others. That said, contributions are optional as this repository primarily demonstrates documentation standards.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the project** on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (e.g., `add/change-management-template`).
3. **Add or edit templates** with clear commit messages explaining the changes.
4. **Submit a Pull Request** for review.

## Guidelines

- Keep templates as generic and reusable as possible.
- Use clear language and standard sections so they can fit a wide range of IT scenarios.
- Ensure new templates follow a similar structure to maintain consistency.
