# IT Documentation Templates

**Purpose:** Provide ready-to-use templates for IT documentation to ensure consistent and clear communication. This repository is intended for IT managers, system administrators, and consultants who want to standardize documents such as standard operating procedures (SOPs) and test plans.

**Technologies/Formats:** Markdown (for portability; can be converted to PDF/Word), adaptable to wikis or documentation platforms.

**Use Cases:**
- Quickly create a new SOP for a routine task (backup, user onboarding, etc.) using the provided template.
- Outline a test plan or test procedure for a project or change control.
- Maintain consistency in documentation across team members and projects.

## Contents

- **SOP Template:** [`SOP_Template.md`](templates/SOP_Template.md) outlines a standard operating procedure format with sections for purpose, scope, steps, etc.
- **Test Plan Template:** [`Test_Plan_Template.md`](templates/Test_Plan_Template.md) provides a structure to document test objectives, environments, steps, and results.

## Usage

1. Choose the template you need and copy it:  
   ```bash
   cp templates/SOP_Template.md docs/My_New_Procedure.md
   ```  
   (You can also copy-paste the content into your organization's documentation system.)
2. Fill in the placeholders and sections with information specific to your procedure or plan.
3. Review and share the completed document with your team or stakeholders.

Keeping documentation up-to-date is as important as initial creation. These templates serve as a starting point to ensure nothing critical is missed when writing IT documents.
